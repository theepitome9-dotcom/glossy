# GLOSSY Pricing Guide

## How Pricing Works

GLOSSY uses a sophisticated multi-factor pricing system:

**Base Price** × **Property Multiplier** × **Postcode Multiplier** = **Final Estimate**

## Base Room Pricing

Based on square meters (m²):

| Dimensions | Square Meters | Min Price | Max Price |

### How Room Matching Works
- User enters dimensions (e.g., 4.2m × 3.7m)
- App calculates square meters (15.54 m² → rounds to 16 m²)
- App finds nearest pricing tier (16 m² matches 4m × 4m)
- Base price: £420-£570

## Property Type Multipliers

Different property types have different ceiling heights, affecting painting time and cost:

| Property Type | Multiplier | Reason |
|--------------|------------|--------|
| Modern       | 1.0×       | Standard ceiling height |
| Flat         | 1.0×       | Standard ceiling height |
| Studio       | 1.0×       | Standard ceiling height |
| Bedsit       | 1.0×       | Standard ceiling height |
| Victorian    | 1.15×      | Slightly higher ceilings |
| Georgian     | 1.25×      | High ceilings (3m+) |

**Example:**
