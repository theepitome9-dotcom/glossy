# GLOSSY - Viral Social Media Content Strategy

## 🎯 Core Message
**"Stop Getting Ripped Off. Know Your Worth."**

---

## 🎬 VIRAL VIDEO/REEL CONCEPTS

### 1. **"The £2,000 Doorbell Ring"** (15-30 seconds)
**Hook:** *Shows tradesperson at door*
- **0-3s:** "He quoted me £2,000 for my 2-bed flat"
- **3-6s:** *Person checks GLOSSY app on phone*
- **6-10s:** *App shows: "£400-£650"*
- **10-12s:** *Person's face in shock*
- **12-15s:** "I got 3 more quotes. Highest was £700."
- **End card:** "GLOSSY - Know before you pay"

**Why it works:** Relatable, shocking, immediate problem → solution


### 2. **"The Tradesperson Test"** (30-60 seconds)
**Format:** Split-screen comparison
- **Left side:** Customer without GLOSSY (confused, nervous, getting overcharged)
- **Right side:** Customer with GLOSSY (confident, informed, fair price)
- **Voiceover:** "Same job. Same house. Different outcomes."
- **End reveal:** "£1,800 vs £650 - Knowledge is power"

**Why it works:** Visual storytelling, clear contrast, educational


### 3. **"What Tradespeople Don't Want You To Know"** (60 seconds)
**Controversial angle - gets views**
- Start with tradesperson saying: *"I charge £50/hour... but the job only took 2 hours"*
- Cut to another: *"I quoted £1,500, cost me £300 in materials and 4 hours work"*
- Text overlay: *"400% markup is common in trades"*
- Solution: *"GLOSSY gives you transparent, location-based estimates"*
- End: *"Fair tradespeople love it too - no more lowball competitors"*

**Why it works:** Controversial, educational, benefits both sides


### 4. **"POV: You Just Saved £1,200"** (15 seconds)
**TikTok/Reels format**
- **Scene:** Person dancing in freshly painted room
- **Text overlay:** "POV: Tradesman quoted £2,000"
- **Next scene:** "GLOSSY said £600-£800"
- **Next scene:** "Got it done for £750"
- **Final scene:** *Shows GLOSSY app with price breakdown*
- **Caption:** "£1,250 saved = holiday money 😎"

**Why it works:** Relatable, aspirational, shows real benefit


### 5. **"The Before/After... Of Your Bank Account"** (30 seconds)
**Financial impact focus**
- **Before GLOSSY:**
  - Shows ridiculous quotes (£3,500 for 1-bed flat)
  - Person stressed, calculator out
  - "How can I afford this?"
- **After GLOSSY:**
  - App shows realistic range (£500-£750)
  - Person relieved, smiling
  - "That's actually doable"
  - Shows happy painted room AND money left in bank

**Why it works:** Financial anxiety is universal


### 6. **"British Home Renovation Horror Stories"** (Series)
**Multi-part storytelling**
- Episode 1: "The £4k quote for a £600 job"
- Episode 2: "The disappearing decorator"
- Episode 3: "Why your mate's cousin isn't cheaper"
- **Each ends with:** "This wouldn't happen with GLOSSY"

**Why it works:** Binge-worthy, relatable UK content, builds community


### 7. **"Rich vs Normal People Getting Quotes"** (45 seconds)
**Class divide angle - very British**
- **Rich person:** "£3,000? Sure, when can you start?"
- **Normal person:** *sweating* "£3,000?! For painting?!"
- **Voiceover:** "Why should only wealthy people not worry about being ripped off?"
- **Shows GLOSSY:** "Everyone deserves fair prices"
- **End:** Working-class person confident, getting fair deal

**Why it works:** Class consciousness, fairness, British sensibility


### 8. **"The Postcode Lottery"** (30 seconds)
**Location-based pricing exposed**
- **Shows map of UK**
- "Same 2-bed flat. Same paint job."
- **Manchester:** "£500-£700"
- **London:** "£900-£1,400"
- **Text:** "Your postcode affects your price by up to 200%"
- **GLOSSY logo:** "Know YOUR area's real prices"

**Why it works:** Educational, shocking, geographically relevant


### 9. **"5 Signs You're Being Ripped Off"** (60 seconds)
**Educational series format**
1. "They won't give you a written quote"
2. "They want 80% upfront"
3. "They can start tomorrow (suspiciously eager)"
4. "Quote is 3x the GLOSSY estimate"
5. "They pressure you to decide NOW"

**End card:** "GLOSSY arms you with knowledge"

**Why it works:** Practical, shareable, positions GLOSSY as expert


### 10. **"The GLOSSY Girl Summer"** (15-20 seconds)
**Gen-Z targeted**
- **Trending audio**
- Girl in overalls, paint roller in hand
- "Homeowner era > Renter era"
- "Got my flat painted for £650 not £2,000"
- "Thanks GLOSSY for the real price"
- Shows beautiful painted flat
- "That's £1,350 for Ibiza 😎"

**Why it works:** Trendy, aspirational, young homeowner market
