}

// Secure action hook (recommended for buttons)

### Simplified Pricing Model (2026-01-07)
**One price fits all: £2.99 per estimate**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| £2-£20 based on property size | £2.99 for any estimate |
| 17 different products | 1 product |
| Complex pricing tiers | Simple, predictable |

**Why £2.99?**
- Psychological pricing - under £3 feels like an impulse buy
- Value perception - professional estimates typically cost £50-150
- App Store sweet spot - converts well globally
- Simpler to manage in App Store Connect

**RevenueCat Configuration:**
- Product: `com.vibecode.glossyquotes.estimate` (£2.99)
- Offering: `estimates` with package `$rc_custom_estimate`
- App Store Product ID: `6757471582`

**One final step in App Store Connect:**
1. Go to App Store Connect → Glossy Quotes → In-App Purchases
2. Find "Professional Estimate - £2.99"
3. Click it → Price Schedule → Add Pricing
4. Select United Kingdom → £2.99
5. Save

### International Pricing System (2026-01-06)
Regional market-adjusted pricing based on January 2025 trade cost research:

| Region | Market Multiplier | Currency | Example (UK £1000 estimate) |
|--------|------------------|----------|----------------------------|
| UK | 1.0x (base) | GBP | £1,000 |
| US | 1.27x | USD | $1,613 |
| Canada | 1.08x | CAD | $1,879 |
| Australia | 1.32x | AUD | $2,574 |
| France | 1.15x | EUR | €1,346 |
| Germany | 0.85x | EUR | €994 |
| Spain | 0.80x | EUR | €936 |
| Netherlands | 0.85x | EUR | €994 |
| Italy | 0.80x | EUR | €936 |
| Poland | 0.65x | EUR | €761 |
| Portugal | 0.70x | EUR | €819 |

**How it works:**
- Prices stored in GBP (UK base)
- Market multiplier adjusts for local trade costs (labor rates differ significantly)
- Exchange rate converts to local currency
- User's locale auto-detected from device settings
- Users can manually change region in Settings > Region

**Region Selector (NEW 2026-01-12):**
- Access via Profile/Settings screen
- Choose from 11 supported regions

## ⚠️ Previous Update (2025-12-08)

### ✅ Fixed Estimate Result Screen Blank Display!
**Estimate prices now show correctly after payment**
- **Issue:** After successful payment, the EstimateResultScreen showed a blank area where the price should be
- **Root Cause:** The gradient background was using invalid Tailwind syntax (`bg-gradient-to-br`) which doesn't work in React Native
- **Solution:** Replaced Tailwind gradient with proper `LinearGradient` component from `expo-linear-gradient`
- **Files Fixed:**
  - src/screens/EstimateResultScreen.tsx - Main estimate card now uses LinearGradient
- **Result:** ✅ Estimate prices (£800-£1,300 range) now display correctly in blue gradient card

**Technical Details:**
- Nativewind doesn't support Tailwind's gradient syntax like `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-600 to-blue-700`
- Must use `<LinearGradient>` component with `colors` prop for gradients in React Native
- The estimate data was always being passed correctly; it was just invisible due to broken gradient rendering

### ✅ Fixed Payment Selection Screen Errors!
**All estimate price tiers now properly configured in RevenueCat ✅ WORKING**
- **Issue:** PaymentSelectionScreen was looking for products in the wrong offering (subscription offering instead of customer_estimates)
- **Solution:**
  - Created all missing estimate products for £2, £4, £6, £8, £10, £14 in Test Store
  - Created corresponding packages in the "Customer Job Estimates" offering
  - Updated PaymentSelectionScreen to fetch from `customer_estimates` offering by lookup key
  - Attached products to packages with proper pricing
- **Products Created:** 6 Test Store products (£2, £4, £6, £8, £10, £14)
- **Packages Created:** 6 packages in customer_estimates offering
- **Code Fixed:** src/screens/PaymentSelectionScreen.tsx now fetches from `offerings.all?.['customer_estimates']`
- **Status:** ✅ WORKING - RevenueCat is now successfully finding and loading all estimate packages
- **How It Works:**
  - User enters room details (e.g., 2 rooms = £4)
  - App calculates price using `getEstimatePriceTier()`
  - PaymentSelectionScreen fetches customer_estimates offering
  - Finds package with matching product identifier (e.g., `com.vibecode.glossyquotes.estimate_4gbp`)
  - Purchases the correct product at the correct price

**RevenueCat Configuration:**
All estimate products are now available in both Test Store and App Store configurations:
- 1 room = £2
- 2 rooms = £4
- 3 rooms = £6
- 4 rooms = £8
- 5+ rooms = £10
- Large properties (package-based) = £14

**Note:** The "Purchase was cancelled" message in logs is expected behavior when you cancel the Test Store purchase prompt - it's not an error!

### ✅ Android/Google Play Support Added!
**Android deployment and Google Play Store support now fully configured**
- **RevenueCat Client:** Now supports Android with Google Play API key
- **App Configuration:** Android settings updated in app.json
- **Deployment Guide:** Complete step-by-step guide created at `GOOGLE_PLAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- **Payment Support:** RevenueCat will work on both iOS and Android
- **What Changed:**
  - Updated `src/lib/revenuecatClient.ts` to support Google Play API keys
  - Added platform detection for iOS (App Store) vs Android (Google Play)
  - Configured app.json with proper Android permissions and settings
  - Created comprehensive deployment guide for Google Play Store

**Next Steps for Android:**
1. Follow the `GOOGLE_PLAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` guide
2. Set up Google Play Console and service account
3. Tell me to set up RevenueCat for Android (I'll create Google Play app and products)
4. Build and deploy to Play Store

## ⚠️ Previous Updates (2025-12-08)

### ✅ Complete Multi-Tier Pricing System Configured
**RevenueCat now supports all 17 price points (£2-£20)**
- **Issue:** App has different prices for different property sizes, but only 3 products existed
- **Solution:** Created products and packages for every price tier in your app
- **Products Created:** 17 App Store products (£2, £3, £4, £5, £6, £7, £8, £9, £10, £11, £12, £13, £14, £15, £16, £18, £20)
- **Packages Created:** 17 packages in the default offering, each linked to the correct product
- **Payment Logic Updated:** App now dynamically selects the correct product based on calculated price
- **How It Works:**
  - User selects package (e.g., "5 Bedroom House" = £20)
  - App calculates price using `getEstimatePriceTier()`
  - Payment screen purchases the correct product (e.g., `com.vibecode.glossyquotes.estimate_20gbp`)
  - User is charged the exact amount shown in the UI

**Before Production:**
You need to create these 17 in-app purchases in App Store Connect with their respective prices:
- `com.vibecode.glossyquotes.estimate_2gbp` → £2.00
- `com.vibecode.glossyquotes.estimate_3gbp` → £3.00
- ... (and so on for all 17 products)

**For Google Play:** Create matching products with the same identifiers and prices.

### ✅ Fixed Test Store Pricing for Estimate Purchases
**RevenueCat Test Store products now configured with correct £2 pricing**
- **Issue:** Test Store was showing £3.99 instead of £2 for estimate purchases
- **Root Cause:** Packages didn't have products attached, so Test Store auto-generated placeholder products with default pricing
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Created App Store products for all three estimate types (Painting, Plastering, Flooring)
  - Attached products to their respective packages in the "Customer Job Estimates" offering
  - Products: `prod2642008aac` (Painting), `prodb9bd6e4e26` (Plastering), `prod70492797d0` (Flooring)
- **App Store Setup Required:** You need to manually configure these products in App Store Connect with £2 pricing
- **For Production:** Set up App Store Connect API credentials in RevenueCat to push products automatically

**Important Note:** The Test Store will still show incorrect pricing until you set up App Store Connect credentials or test on a production build with the App Store key. The pricing in the app UI is correct - it's just the Test Store sandbox that shows placeholder pricing.

### ✅ Fixed Purchase Cancellation Error Logs
**RevenueCat purchase cancellation handling improved**
- **Issue:** When users cancelled a purchase, RevenueCat was logging it as an error with a stack trace
- **Fix:** Changed log level from DEBUG to INFO to reduce noise from user cancellations
- **Impact:** Purchase cancellations are now handled silently (as expected behavior)
- **File Updated:** `src/lib/revenuecatClient.ts:43`

### ✅ RevenueCat Payment Integration COMPLETE!
**All payment flows now fully integrated with RevenueCat**

The app now has complete RevenueCat integration for all payment types:

**Customer Estimate Payments:**
- ✅ Integrated with "Customer Job Estimates" offering
- ✅ Three packages: Painting, Plastering, and Flooring estimates

- Added `getPackageFromOffering()` for fetching packages from specific offerings
- Added `purchaseProductFromOffering()` for purchasing from specific offerings
- All screens now properly fetch and purchase from correct RevenueCat offerings
- Comprehensive logging for debugging payment flows

### 🔄 Payment System Migration to RevenueCat
**IMPORTANT: Stripe has been fully removed from the app**
- All Stripe payment links, configurations, and API code have been removed
- Payment functionality now uses RevenueCat exclusively
- Stripe Supabase Edge Functions have been deleted
- All Stripe documentation files have been cleaned up
- Payment screens show migration notices and need to be updated to use RevenueCat

**What This Means:**
- Customer estimate payments: ✅ Fully integrated with RevenueCat - ready to use!
- Professional credit purchases: ✅ Fully integrated with RevenueCat - ready to use!
- Premium subscriptions: ✅ Already working via RevenueCat Premium screen
- No Stripe code remains in the codebase to avoid confusion

### 🔒 CRITICAL: Removed Stripe Branding
**BRANDING FIX** - Removed all Stripe references from user-facing UI:
- Changed "Secure payment powered by Stripe" → "Secure payment processing"
- Changed "Stripe" mentions to generic "payment page" and "checkout"
- Updated all payment flow messaging to be payment-provider agnostic

**Files:**
- `src/config/translations.ts` - Generic payment messaging in all languages

### 🔒 CRITICAL: Fixed Price Range Shown Before Payment
**SECURITY FIX** - Removed price range display on Get Estimate screen:
- **Issue:** Job estimate prices (£250-£650, etc.) were visible BEFORE payment
- **Risk:** Customers could see estimate ranges without paying
- **Fix:** Removed price range from package selection screen
- **Now:** Customers only see package description and link fee until they pay
- **Also Fixed:** Single room price range adjusted from £250-£650 to £250-£450 (more accurate)

### ✅ Trade-Specific Estimate Results (2026-01-12)
**Fixed estimate results showing wrong trade content:**
- **Issue:** All estimate results showed painting-specific content (woodwork, ceiling/walls) regardless of trade
- **Fix:** Estimate results now show trade-specific content:
  - Header shows correct trade name (e.g., "tiling cost estimate" not "painting cost estimate")
  - Estimate label matches trade (TILING ESTIMATE, KITCHEN FITTING ESTIMATE, etc.)
  - Woodwork section only shows for painting-decorating trade
  - Trade-specific disclaimers for each trade type
  - Professional CTA mentions correct trade professionals

### ✅ High-End Cities Disclaimer (2026-01-12)
**Added pricing disclaimer for major cities:**
- New amber warning box on all estimate results
- Text: "Note: High-end cities like London, NYC, or Sydney may exceed the high-range estimates due to parking fees, congestion charges, and logistics."
- Protects app from misleading customers about city-specific pricing factors
- Appears below trade-specific disclaimer

### 🔒 CRITICAL: Fixed Payment Security Bypass
**SECURITY FIX** - Removed auto-mark-as-paid vulnerability in TEST MODE:
- **Issue:** Users could see estimates without completing payment (2-second auto-mark)
- **Risk:** Payment bypass vulnerability in test mode
- **Fix:** Removed automatic marking as paid - users MUST complete Stripe checkout
- **Now:** Users see proper message to complete payment, no estimate shown until verified

### ✅ Fixed Job Posting Screen Trade Display
Fixed multiple bugs where job posting screen showed incorrect trade information:
- **Issue 1:** Badge always showed "Painting & Decorating" regardless of selected trade
- **Issue 2:** Showed "1 room(s) • 1 m²" for package-based estimates (plastering/flooring)
- **Issue 3:** Placeholder text said "painting project" for all trades
- **Fix:** Now dynamically detects trade from package ID and shows correct information
- **Details:**
  - Badge shows correct trade category (Plastering, Flooring, or Painting & Decorating)
  - Room count and m² only show for detailed painting estimates (not quick quote packages)
  - Placeholder text matches the selected trade

### ✅ Fixed Payment Screen Trade Display
Fixed bug where payment screen was showing incorrect trade information:
- **Issue:** Payment screen always showed "painting" text regardless of selected trade
- **Fix:** Now dynamically shows correct trade (plastering, flooring, or painting)
- **Details:** Payment benefits now match the selected package trade category
